## FBAT Bank

## Proposal
First part would be to write a script that would log into your bank account and download the excel file of your bank statements, whether it's automatically every month or the user would just run it when they want to update it. Then we may take the raw data and enter it into a database. Database would track your spending/saving. We could then create visuals for the data however we want, categorize transactions, etc. User can set savings and spending limits.

The thing I think would be most beneficial/fun to make (that I would love to have for myself) is create a running visual log showing spending trends vs. saving goals and making it easy to see things like "oh, based on my current trends if I just ate 1 less lunch out a month I could buy a house in 5 years instead of 7." Could also create a tool to factor in big purchases/income/student loans and how those affect savings goals.

We could do the whole UI ouselves and make it sexy and I think it would be a good way to blend the online lessons and learn from existing code that people have written so we don't try to reinvent the wheel in certain areas like you mentioned.
