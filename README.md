## FBAT Bank

## Proposal
First part would be to write a script that would log into your bank account and download the excel file of your bank statements, whether it's automatically every month or the user would just run it when they want to update it. Then we may take the raw data and enter it into a database. Database would track your spending/saving. We could then create visuals for the data however we want, categorize transactions, etc. User can set savings and spending limits.

The thing I think would be most beneficial/fun to make (that I would love to have for myself) is create a running visual log showing spending trends vs. saving goals and making it easy to see things like "oh, based on my current trends if I just ate 1 less lunch out a month I could buy a house in 5 years instead of 7." Could also create a tool to factor in big purchases/income/student loans and how those affect savings goals.

We could do the whole UI ouselves and make it sexy and I think it would be a good way to blend the online lessons and learn from existing code that people have written so we don't try to reinvent the wheel in certain areas like you mentioned.

## MVP
*	Product Goal #1 - Provide the user with a simple platform for the user to create a personal financial plan (monthly budget and long savings plan)
*	Product Goal #2 - Product should be capable of accessing user financial accounts to obtain data on the user's financial activity
*	Product Goal #3 - create an interactive tool that provides visual representation of the correlation between spending habits and savings trajectory, giving them the ability to modify either financial plan on this information


## Stretch Goals
*	Stretch Goal #1 - Automatic transaction categorization of purchases from new entities
*	Stretch Goal #2 - Incorporate funds from brokerage accounts into long term savings plans
*	Stretch Goal #3 - Realtime activity updates

## Database Schema


## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to... create and customize my financial plan with subcategories and the option to budget/save based on a percentage of a category's total allocation or a flat sum 
* As a user, I should be able to... access snapshots of past financial states and easily understand my current financial trajectory
* As a user, I should be able to... know my net worth accross all accounts after monthly expenses are accounted for
* As a user, I should be able to... use the interactive visual tool to expedite my planning process
* As a user, I should be able to... create multiple plans and factor in future expenses

## Program flexibility thoughts


## Known Bugs
